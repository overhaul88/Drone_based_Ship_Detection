## Drone based Ship Detection using Deep Learning
- This repository contains all the work I have done on a project to detect and classify ships, as seen from drone camera's live feed.
- /Ship_Detection contains files for bounding-box type detection and classification of 7 classes of ships as seen from ariel view.
- The dataset for Ship Detection can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ussW4mjjVqR-_wEQH5DKhYq0I6QcmqJn?usp=sharing
- /Object_Tracking contains files for detecting object in focus and controlling the gimbal's movements for the subject to remain in camera's view. This repo is bieng updated as the work progresses.
